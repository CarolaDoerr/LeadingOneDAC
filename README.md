This repo is for the paper: **Theory-inspired Parameter Control Benchmarks for Dynamic Algorithm Configuration**

The DAC environment is based on the Dynamic Algorithm Configuration benchmark library [DACBench](https://github.com/automl/DACBench).

For computing the optimal DAC policy for RLS (Randomized Local Search) on LeadingOne problem, please check the instructions in `rls_lo/optimal_policy/`.

For training/evaluating a DDQN agent on this benchmark, please see the instructions in `rls_lo/rl`.
